NAME
----

git-unify - Share .git directory among local repositories of same origin

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git unify' init
'git unify' deinit
'git unify' clone <repository> [<path>]
'git unify' submodule-add <repository> [<path>]
'git unify' submodule-update [<path>]
'git unify' shared-dir [--verify]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Shares files under .git directory among local repositories to squeeze disk
usage and/or speed up clone speed. Especially useful for example if you
have many repositories that uses same submodules.

COMMANDS
--------
init::
	Share files (eg. refs, objects) of repository's .git directory under
	"$HOME/.shared-git" (by default) so that other local clones of the
	same origin can use shared files there. The files are moved to central
	and symlink to them are placed under local .git directory.
+
If shared .git directory is already set up and the shared refs are not
fast-forward of local refs, this command will fail. If so, push your local
changes to remote (if any), and run command below to make shared refs
up-to-date.
+
------------
$ git push origin the-branch
$ git unify update-shared-branch the-branch
------------

deinit::
	Reverts the effect of 'git unify init'. Files under .git directoy are
	no longer shared (not symlinked).

clone::
	Does 'git clone' with shared .git directory used/set up. If the remote
        repository is already shared ('git unify init' is done somewhere),
        it does not fetches remote directory but instead clones from the
        shared .git directory.

submodule-add::
	Does 'git submodule add' with shared .git directory used/set up.

submodule-update::
	Does 'git submodule update --init' with shared .git directory used/set up.

shared-dir::
	Prints shared .git directory for current repository. Exits with non-zero code if '--verify'
	is specified and the directory does not exist.

SHARING .git DIRECTORIES
------------------------

git-unify shares .git/refs, so local repositories of same origin that are
unified shares their branches. Branch updating at one working directory would
affect the other.
